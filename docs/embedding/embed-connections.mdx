You can use the embedded SDK to create connections.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Initialize the SDK">
        Follow the instructions in the [Embed Builder](../embed-builder).
    </Step>
    <Step title="Call Connect Method">
        After initializing the SDK, you will have access to a property called `activepieces` inside your `window` object. Call its `connect` method to open a new connection dialog as follows.

        ```html
        <script> 
        activepieces.connect({pieceName:'@activepieces/piece-google-sheets'});
        </script>
        ```

        **Connect Parameters:**

        | Parameter Name | Required | Type   | Description                                 |
        | -------------- | -------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------- |
        | pieceName      | âœ…       | string | The name of the piece you want to create a connection for.

        **Connect Result**

        The `connect` method returns a `promise` that resolves to the following object:

        ```ts
        {
            connection?: {
                id: string,
                name: string
            }
        }
        ```

        <Info>
        `connection` is undefined if the user closes the dialog and doesn't create a connection.
        </Info>

        <Tip>
        You can use the `connections` piece in the builder to retrieve the created connection using its name.
