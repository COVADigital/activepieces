<Tip>
  Set up Activepieces using helmcharts for easy deployment The helmchart is
  configurable enough to allow for personal, testing and production (corporate)
  installs We suggest using PostgreSQL and Redis value configurations for
  production deployments.
</Tip>

To get up and running quickly with Activepieces, we will use the Activepieces helmchart. Follow these steps:

## Prerequisites

You need to have your Kubernetes cluster running, configured to be accessible from the machine you are running this from. You will also need Helm installed on your machine in order to set up Activepieces via Helmchart.

## Install

### Add the helmchart repository

Add the helmchart repository with the following command:

```bash
helm repo add meyercharts https://mariomeyer.github.io/repo
```

### Customize the values you want for your helm install

Copy the following default values to a local `values.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Default values for activepieces.
# This is a YAML-formatted file.
# Declare variables to be passed into your templates.

replicaCount: 1

image:
  repository: docker.io/activepieces/activepieces
  pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
  # Overrides the image tag whose default is the chart appVersion.
  tag: 'latest'

imagePullSecrets: []
nameOverride: ''
fullnameOverride: ''

serviceAccount:
  # Specifies whether a service account should be created
  create: true
  # Automatically mount a ServiceAccount's API credentials?
  automount: true
  # Annotations to add to the service account
  annotations: {}
  # The name of the service account to use.
  # If not set and create is true, a name is generated using the fullname template
  name: ''

podAnnotations: {}
podLabels: {}

  #    hosts:
  #      - chart-example.local

resources:
  {}
  # We usually recommend not to specify default resources and to leave this as a conscious
  # choice for the user. This also increases chances charts run on environments with little
  # resources, such as Minikube. If you do want to specify resources, uncomment the following
  # lines, adjust them as necessary, and remove the curly braces after 'resources:'.
  # limits:
  #   cpu: 100m
  #   memory: 128Mi
  # requests:
  #   cpu: 100m
  #   memory: 128Mi

#     secretName: mysecret
#     optional: false

# Additional volumeMounts on the output Deployment definition.

### Apply the chart

Run the following command to apply the chart in your Kuberentes cluster:

```bash
helm install -f values.yaml activepieces meyercharts/activepieces
```

## Upgrade

Please follow the steps below:

### Reconfigure values.yaml

Do any changes on your `values.yaml` file with the desired configuration changes. You can also change the tag from `latest` to any version you'd like to upgrade to.

### Upgrade

```bash
helm upgrade -f values.yaml activepieces meyercharts/activepieces -n default
```

Congratulations! You have successfully upgraded your Activepieces helm deployment
