## Authentication

## Setting up your Discord Connection in Activepieces

Congratulations on your decision to connect your Discord account to Activepieces! We know it can be a bit daunting, but we're here to guide you every step of the way. 

### Step 1: Create an Application
First things first, head over to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create a new application. Give it a catchy name (we suggest "ActivePieces Bot" or something similarly snazzy).

### Step 2: Navigate to the OAuth2 Page
On the left sidebar, you'll see a menu option labeled "OAuth2." Click that and then select the "General" page.

### Step 3: Copy the Client ID and Secret
On the General page, you'll see a section labeled "Client ID." That's the number we'll need to enter into Activepieces later on. Go ahead and copy that.

While you're there, scroll down to the "Client Secret" section and reset the secret. Copy that too and keep it safe! We'll need it later.

### Step 4: Add a Redirect URL
Still on the General page, scroll down to the "Redirects" section. Click the "Add Redirect" button, and enter the "OAuth Redirect URL from Activepieces" (if you're not sure what that is, don't worry - you'll find it in Activepieces when you're ready to connect your account). 

### Step 5: Add a Bot
Switch over to the "Bot" page on the left sidebar. If you haven't already, go ahead and add a bot to your application. Just hit that "Add Bot" button, and confirm the warning that pops up.

### Step 6: Get your Bot Token
Once your bot is set up, you'll see a section labeled "Token." Go ahead and click the "Reset" button next to it, and copy the new token that appears. Keep that handy too - we'll need it later.

### Step 7: Connect Your Account in Activepieces
Head on over to Activepieces, and navigate to the Discord Connection settings.  Enter the "Client ID", "Client Secret", and "Bot Token" values you saved earlier in their respective fields.

### Step 8: Celebrate!
Hit the "Submit" button, and that's it! You're all set. You can now use your Discord connection within your flows.
