Congratulations on setting up your development environment! Now, let's dive into creating a new Circle piece for Circle.so.

Circle.so is a dynamic online community platform designed to foster meaningful discussions and collaboration among users with shared interests.

### Piece Defination

To get started, letâ€™s generate a new piece for Circle.so

```bash
npm run cli pieces create
```

You will be asked three questions to define your new piece:

1. Piece Name: Enter a name for piece.
2. Package Name: Enter a name for npm package.You can leave it to use default name.
3. Piece Type: Piece type either custom or community.

**Example:**

```bash
npm run cli pieces circle

? Enter the piece name: circle
? Enter the package name: @activepieces/piece-circle
? Select the piece type: community
```

This will create new `Circle` piece at `packages/pieces/community/circle/`,the `src/index.ts` file should contain following code.

```typescript filename='index.ts'
import { createPiece, PieceAuth } from '@activepieces/pieces-framework';

export const circle = createPiece({
  displayName: 'Circle',
  auth: PieceAuth.None(),
  minimumSupportedRelease: '0.9.0',
  logoUrl: 'https://cdn.activepieces.com/pieces/circle.png',
  authors: [],
  actions: [],
  triggers: [],
});
```

### Piece Authentication

After creating piece first step is to create Authentication for piece.Based on piece Authetication differe Basic,Oauth2 or API Key.Activepices supports all typeof authentication. You can read more about auth in [Piece Auth](https://www.activepieces.com/docs/developers/piece-reference/authentication) section.

To identify which type of Auth piece provide for thier API, we need to read API documentation of particular piece.As we are creating `Circle` piece, you can refer Circle API docs [here](https://www.make.com/en/use-cases/build-custom-app-in-make)

Many application provide postman collection for thier API.We can use postamn to test for better API testing.

As Circle API use API Key for authentication, we will use [Secret Text](https://www.activepieces.com/docs/developers/piece-reference/authentication#secret-text) for piece auth.

Let's create new variable for auth in `index.ts` file.

````typescript
export const circleAuth = PieceAuth.SecretText({
    displayName:'API Key',
    required : true,
    description : `
    To obtain API Key for these steps:

    1. Log in to your Circle account.
    2. Navigate to **settings->API**.
    3. Copy API key to clipboard.
    `
})```
````

Every piece auth takes three required properties `displayName`,`required` and `description`.

- displayName: Auth name in UI.
- required : true if auth is mandatory.
- description: steps to establish connection.

now let's use this auth variable in piece defination in `index.ts` file.

```typescript
import { createPiece, PieceAuth } from '@activepieces/pieces-framework';

export const circleAuth = PieceAuth.SecretText({
  displayName: 'API Key',
  required: true,
  description: `
    To obtain API Key for these steps:

    1. Log in to your Circle account.
    2. Navigate to **settings->API**.
    3. Copy API key to clipboard.
    `,
});

export const circle = createPiece({
  displayName: 'Circle',
  auth: circleAuth, // auth varible
  minimumSupportedRelease: '0.9.0',
  logoUrl: 'https://cdn.activepieces.com/pieces/circle.png',
  authors: [],
  actions: [],
  triggers: [],
});
```
