Congratulations on setting up your development environment! Now, let's dive into creating a new `Clickup` piece.

ClickUp is a versatile and intuitive project management platform designed to streamline collaboration and productivity.

### Piece Defination

To get started, letâ€™s generate a new piece for Clickup.

```bash
npm run cli pieces create
```

You will be asked three questions to define your new piece:

1. `Piece Name`: Specify a name for your piece. This name uniquely identifies your piece within the ActivePieces ecosystem.
2. `Package Name`: Optionally, you can enter a name for the npm package associated with your piece. If left blank, the default name will be used.
3. `Piece Type`: Choose the piece type based on your intention. It can be either "custom" if it's a tailored solution for your needs, or "community" if it's designed to be shared and used by the broader community.

**Example:**

```bash
npm run cli pieces create

? Enter the piece name: clickup
? Enter the package name: @activepieces/piece-clickup
? Select the piece type: community
```

This will create new `Clickup` piece at `packages/pieces/community/clickup/`,the `src/index.ts` file should contain following code.

```typescript
import { createPiece, PieceAuth } from '@activepieces/pieces-framework';

export const clickup = createPiece({
  displayName: 'Clickup',
  auth: PieceAuth.None(),
  minimumSupportedRelease: '0.9.0',
  logoUrl: 'https://cdn.activepieces.com/pieces/clickup.png',
  authors: [],
  actions: [],
  triggers: [],
});
```
