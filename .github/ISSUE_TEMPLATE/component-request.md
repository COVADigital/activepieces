## Tell us about the new component you'd like to have

- Do you need a specific version of the underlying data source (e.g. an older version of the API or database)?

## Describe the context around this new component

- Why do you need this integration? How does your team intend to use the component? This helps us understand the use case.
- How often do you want to run the component's actions?
- If this is a component for an API source, which entities/endpoints do you need supported?
- If the component requires a paid service, can we name you as a mutual user when we subscribe for an account? Which company should we name?

## Describe the alternative you are considering or using

What are you considering doing if you don't have this integration through Activepieces?

## Are you willing to submit a PR?

<!--
We accept and love contributions!
We have a component development kit (CDK) that helps simplify the process of building a new component with triggers and actions. If you are familiar with Typescript, this can be a good way to help us add a new component! You can check out the #component-development discord channel to get more information about building a component or to receive help during the process.

Don't feel pressured in any way. We understand if you can't submit a PR and we're tremendously grateful that you've already contributed by suggesting a new integration.
